# Climate-Change
Climate change is a major global issue that is affecting our planet in many ways. To analyze and understand this problem, the [IMF Climate Change dataset](https://climatedata.imf.org/pages/climatechange-data) is an excellent resource to explore the key indicators such as carbon dioxide atmospheric concentrations, rising sea levels, and temperatures.

To work with this dataset, I have taken the following steps:

* Imported the dataset into my project, ensuring that it is accessible for analysis.
* Imported important libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, and sklearn, which are necessary for manipulating and analyzing the data.
* Used data visualization techniques to explore the relationships between the different variables in the dataset and gain insights into climate change trends.
* Created train, test, and validation data frames using sklearn to prepare for the development of a machine learning model.
* Created the train and test datasets by splitting the numpy arrays into appropriate sets.
* Developed a function to define the machine learning model, which takes in the input data, trains the model, and returns the trained model.
* Created a machine learning model using sklearn to predict climate change trends based on the data.
* Tested the performance of the model using the test set and evaluated its accuracy using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error.

By following these steps, I can gain insights into the impact of climate change on our planet and the potential consequences for populations around the world. Armed with this knowledge, I can work towards reducing the harmful effects of climate change and promoting sustainable development.
